# Development

- **4/17/20** Integrated Box2D into Cinder 
     - Followed simple tutorial on how to create a static and dynamic body 
     - ~~Need to figure out how to display bodies to GUI~~
- **4/24/20** Implemented logic to draw to GUI using particles 
     - Can clear the GUI when the spacebar is pressed
     - ~~Need to make it so that particles don't fall with gravity once they're drawn~~
- **4/25/20** Made GUI particles static so they don't fall once they're drawn 
    - Can change color of particles with a keystroke
- **4/30/20** Can change the body of the particles to dynamic (so particles fall with gravity)
    - Need to figure out how to change the shape of the particles once they are drawn 
    - Can change the size of the particles 
    - ~~Need to create a legend for the GUI and a start screen~~
- **5/4/20** Created a legend for the GUI 
    - Need to add test cases 
    - Need to add background music
